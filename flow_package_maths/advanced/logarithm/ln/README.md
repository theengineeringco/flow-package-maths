Computes the natural logarithm of the given `Value`. The natural logarithm of a value is a logarithm with the base of Euler's constant, $e$ typically written as $log_{e}(x)$ or $ln(x)$. There a few interesting properties to note:

- The natural logarithm of $e$, $ln(e) = 1$ since $e^{1} = e$.
- The natural logarithm of $1$, $ln(1) = 0$ since the power of 0 to any value is always one, $e^{0} = 1$.
