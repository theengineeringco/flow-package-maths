Computes the logarithm of the given `Value` and its base. The logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation as shown in the two expressions below:

$$
log_{b}(x) = y
$$
$$
b^{y} = x
$$

For example:

$$
log_{10}(1000) = 3
$$

There are three widely used logarithms:
- Common logarithm, $log_{10}(x)$
- Natural logarithm, $log_{e}(x)$
- Binary logarithm, $log_{2}(x)$
